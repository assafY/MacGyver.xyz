# MacGyver.xyz

I built this website in one night of boredom. It comprised of a full screen animated gif showing the MacGyver logo with an explosion behind it, and the MacGyver music on repeat.

A month into the site's life on Macgyver.xyz, I received an email from CBS threatening a law suit.

A new, non-infringing Macgyver tribute page is coming soon.
